# FLIP Project - `.editorconfig` Template

## Overview

Welcome to the FLIP project! This project is dedicated to developing a cutting-edge payment application with dynamic QR code generation capabilities. To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, we have standardized our coding style using a ".editorconfig" file. This file ensures uniform coding practices across various editors and IDEs used by our team.

## Why Use the `.editorconfig` File?

The ".editorconfig" file maintains consistent coding styles across different environments. Enforcing a common set of rules helps prevent formatting discrepancies that can lead to merge conflicts or reduce code readability. This consistency is key to the success of the FLIP project as we collaborate across various features and modules.

### Key Benefits:
- **Consistency:** Ensures all contributors adhere to the same coding standards.
- **Collaboration:** Reduces merge conflicts related to code style differences.
- **Code Quality:** Enhances readability and maintainability of the codebase.
